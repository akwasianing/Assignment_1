Visualization 1: Math Score Distribution by Parental Education Level
Explanation: 
This visualization (boxplot) which displays the math score distribution by parental education helps to easily identify whether parental education influences math performance.
It can help us to see whether higher parental education is generally associated with better math scores and the vice versa. for instance it can be seen that parents with master's degree seem to have their kids perform better in math.
It can also reveal in the case of outliers if other factors have roles to play in math score.


Visualization 2: Count of Test Preparation Course Completion by Gender
Explanation: 
The plot shows the count of students who either completed or did not complete the test preparation course, and this count is categorized by gender.
This comparison reveals trends in test preparation participation, highlighting whether one gender prepares more or if completion rates are balanced.


Visualization 3: Scatter Plot of Math vs. Reading Scores, Colored by Gender
Explanation: 
This visualization displays the relationship between math scores and reading scores with an additional color coding based on gender.
By color-coding the points based on gender, we can quickly assess if the relationship between math and reading scores differs by gender.


Visualization 4: Impact of Test Preparation on Writing Scores
Explanation: 
This visualization shows the distribution of writing scores based on whether or not students completed a test preparation course.
For instance, it can be seen that the median writing score for students who completed the test preparation course is higher than than those who did not, which suggests that test preparation may have a positive impact on writing scores.


Visualization 5: Math Scores by Parental Education Level and Test Preparation Course
Explanation: 
This visualization makes it easy to compare the math scores for students who completed vs those who did not complete the test preparation course, broken down by parental education level.
It can address the question whether students whose parents have higher educational attainment have higher math scores, and that completing the test preparation course might improve the scores across all parental education levels.
